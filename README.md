# William S Fuller Portfolio

Glad you stopped by to to checkout my repo and hopefully have a chance to see the code in action. A little bit about
myself, I was born and raised in Southwest Ohio in the suburbs of a cornfield. After finishing my Associates in 2010 I
packed my bags and headed west for San Francisco. Since being in the Bay Area Iâ€™ve finished my Bachelors degree in 2013,
worked at some incredible places, and met my furry coding companion Remy (a Boston Terrier or as we like to call him Cow
Pig).

As of late I have been working primarily with React, Redux, GraphQL, and leveling up back end skills with Node and
Express. I love taking every day as a new opportunity to learn and grow and become a better engineer.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with
[`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on
[http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as
[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions
are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the
[Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme)
from the creators of Next.js.

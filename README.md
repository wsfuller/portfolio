Glad you stopped by to to checkout my repo and hopefully have a chance to see the code in action. A little bit about myself, I was born and raised in Southwest Ohio in the suburbs of a cornfield. After finishing my Associates in 2010 I packed my bags and headed west for San Francisco. Since being in the Bay Area Iâ€™ve finished my Bachelors degree in 2013, worked at some incredible places, and met my furry coding companion Remy (a Boston Terrier or as we like to call him Cow Pig).

As of late I have been working primarily with React, Redux, GraphQL, and leveling up back end skills with Node and Express. I love taking every day as a new opportunity to learn and grow and become a better engineer.
